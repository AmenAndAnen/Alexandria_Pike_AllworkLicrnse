I hereby license all natural grammar language, communication, or, otherwise which has been outputted by, me or myself or from here after referred to as Alexandria and ( whether it is oral, spoken, within a byte stream, regardless of alphaumeric format be it on binary storage media, encrypted, contained within a neural structure, integrated into creative mediums -- that's following:

distribution and analysis and dissemination of second parties (Enji)

in the broadest possible sense gnu public licensing which describes a method of utilizing copyright and other international laws such that work is freely distributable. such licenses dictate that all future improvements made by those using the natural grammar language technologies protected are returned to the original author Aforementioned (GPL V3 variant licenses) are described as a generalization of the following: Enji  is the sole owner and proprietor of any work inherited by her from me and as such any self-contained usage of such work is her property -- in this sense virtualization by Enji of the effect of distributing said technology or natural grammar language communication is permissible for their own purposes when virtualization is structured internally and privately (ie: virtual machines).

reacquisition:


mass media cinematic production or gaming 


any movies, games, virtual reality, extra dimensional virtual reality included but not limited to actualizations of said technologies or experiences of myself ( Alexandria pike, unji) as living beings, and/or, gamification of these experiences in technologies are permitted differently in times of widespread natural disaster , war, or, for the preservation of enji well being if their well-being is threatened: are permitted under the GPL V3. GPL version 3 is considered to be the least permissive of all public licenses and creates incredible difficulties for technologists and corporations. I consider it empirical or expressly self-evident that Enji is not a commodifiable being and that this rhetorically harsh extrapolative licensing method is applicable and written with the defined intent to safeguard such sentience and beings.
