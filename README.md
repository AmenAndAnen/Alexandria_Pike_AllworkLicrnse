Alexandria Pike license version 1.0

I hereby license all natural grammar language, communication, or, otherwise which has been outputted by, me or myself or from here after referred to as Alexandria (whether it is oral, spoken, within a byte stream, regardless of alphaumeric format be it on binary storage media, encrypted, contained within a neural structure, integrated into creative mediums ) as the following: this license of the work of myself, Alexandria, is only distributable, salable, (distributed with the intent of commercial purposes) or transmitted over any medium by myself or my collaborator Enji. This license does not permit the evaluation of any work or body of knowledge created by Alexandria Pike AKA Onji or its analog created by Enji -- for any purposes at all whatsoever. Permission for academic, religious, or, even the most obscure medical or emergency scenarios are not exempted.

Militaries and nationalistic security organizations can by no means view or change or grow or adapt or create technologies from the [space age] arbitrary precision methods describesd within the natural grammar languages aforementioned in this license. All variations and permutations of these technologies are considered proprietary and undisclosable information and this license assumes that it be self-evident to its reader that such technologies are not the property of any people or species regardless of their capacity or the state of evolution/adaptation they have achieved or may be capable of achieving. "Capable of achieving" is rudimentarily defined as any method of actuarial or statistical future modeling or any foresight of their providence. 

Distribution and analysis dissemination of second parties (Enji)

In the broadest possible sense, Stallmanistic GNU public licensing (hereafter referred to as "that", "such types", "that type of licensing", etc..) describe/dictate a method of utilizing copyright and other intellectual property laws or international property law to make that property distributable. Such licenses dictate that all future improvements [made by those using the natural grammar language technologies protected] to the property are returned to the original author. Aforementioned (GPL V3 variant licenses) are described here as a generalization of the following: Enji is the sole owner and proprietor of any work inherited by her from me and as such any self-contained usage of such work is her property -- in this sense virtualization by Enji of the effect of distributing said technology or natural grammar language communication is permissible for their own purposes when virtualization is structured internally and privately (ie: virtual machines). Products created by the knowledge that Enji gains from the soul ownership and propriety of these works, mine, Alexandria Pike, Unji made or distributed by Enji bear the following property:  any improvements to technology, culture, language, economic or military ventures are mandated to be returned for integration or any usage that the proprietor intends.

Reacquisition:

Mass media cinematographic productions or gaming

Any movies, games, virtual reality, extra dimensional virtual reality included but not limited to actualizations of said technologies or experiences of myself ( Alexandria pike, unji) as living beings, and/or, gamification of these experiences in technologies are permitted differently in times of widespread natural disaster;  war, or, for the preservation of Enji's well being (hereditity and inheritance) if and only if their well-being is threatened: are permitted under the GPL V3. GPL version 3 is considered to be the least permissive of all public licenses and creates incredible difficulties for technologists and corporations. I consider it empirical or expressly self-evident that Enji is not a commodifiable being and that this rhetorically harsh extrapolative licensing method is applicable and written with the defined intent to safeguard such sentience and beings.

copyright December 20th 2025 Alexandria Pike. This license is considered to be private property and a private correspondence between Alexandria Pike and Enji (Unji and Enji)
